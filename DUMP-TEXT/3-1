   Basketball title games coming to Portland’s CIA

   The Maine Principals’ Association and America East have worked out an
   agreement that will allow the Class AA and Class A state championship
   games to be held at the Cross Insurance Arena this year.

   America East will hold its tournament, including quarterfinal and
   semifinal games, at the CIA in Portland on March 3 and 4, with
   practices scheduled for March 1 and 2.

   The MPA and America East agreed to have the practices end by 4 p.m. on
   March 1 and 2, allowing the Class AA and Class A title games to be
   played at the CIA later on those nights.

   The Class A boys’ and girls’ title games will be held on Thursday,
   March 1, at CIA; the Class AA boys’ and girls’ title games will be held
   on Friday, March 2, at CIA with a split session.

   “The concession that America East afforded us to that they decided to
   arrange all their practice sessions earlier in the day on Thursday and
   Friday, and they would give up the facility for the evening,” said Dick
   Durost, the executive director of the MPA. “This is something we’ve
   talked about for several months.

   “This really is a win for everyone involved.”

   The MPA was unable to hold any of its state championship games in
   Portland last year because of a conflict with the America East
   tournament schedule.

   The Class B state championship games will be held in Bangor on Friday,
   March 2. The Class C and Class D state championship games will be held
   at the Augusta Civic Center on Saturday, March 3.

   PREP SCHOOLS

   GIRLS’ SOCCER: Aaliyah Farid and Brayden Reed each scored twice as host
   Berwick (10-2-1) defeated Waring 6-1. Kenza Farid and Rayne Zimmerman
   also scored for the Bulldogs.

   BOYS’ SOCCER: Tucker Smith scored twice as host Berwick (7-5) edged
   Lexington Christian Academy 2-1.

   AUTO RACING

   NASCAR: Martin Truex Jr. continued his winning ways at Kansas Speedway,
   capturing the pole for this weekend’s NASCAR Cup Series playoff
   elimination race.

   With that prize came the chance to have pit choice at Martinsville,
   Virginia. The paper clip-like geometry of that track makes stall
   selection arguably the biggest advantage of any track all season,

   FORMULA ONE: Season championship points leader Lewis Hamilton posted
   the fastest laps in two practice sessions for the U.S. Grand Prix,
   putting more pressure on title rival Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, who
   spun into the gravel and completed just 11 laps in in Austin, Texas.

   GOLF

   CHAMPIONS TOUR: Bernhard Langer birdied the par-5 18th for a 5-under 67
   and a share of the first-round lead in the Dominion Energy Charity
   Classic in Richmond, Virginia, the first event in the Charles Schwab
   Cup Playoffs.

   Seeking an unprecedented fifth Schwab Cup and fourth in a row, the
   60-year-old Langer leads the season standings and has a tour-high five
   victories this season.

   EUROPEAN TOUR: With the help of an albatross from 227 yards out, Joost
   Luiten shot a 1-under 70 to take a one-stroke lead over tournament host
   Sergio Garcia and two others at the Andalucia Valderrama Masters in
   Spain.

   TENNIS

   KREMLIN CUP: Julia Goerges will seek to end a six-year wait for a title
   when she faces Daria Kasatkina of Russia in Saturday’s final in Moscow.

   Goerges beat Natalia Vikhlyantseva 6-2, 2-6, 7-5.

The UK’s £9billion traffic jam problem needs radical solutions according to
the boss of the AA

   Britain's traffic jams costs the economy £9billion every year. The boss
   of roadside assistance provider the AA says radical solutions are
   needed.

   HOW was your commute today? Did you zip into work, pulling up to the
   car park with plenty of time to grab a coffee before starting another
   busy day?

   Sadly, for many of us the answer will be a big fat “no”. And the reason
   is likely to be the same — traffic.

   on Britain's road problems

   There are now an astonishing 3,700 traffic jams on motorways and
   A-roads EVERY DAY in Britain — 1.35million a year.

   Yesterday it was revealed the problem goes beyond mere inconvenience
   and boredom, as traffic jams are costing our economy an unacceptable
   £9billion a year.

   The key problem here is just how long it takes for the authorities to
   unblock traffic.

   A major smash on the motorway — particularly if there has been a
   fatality — can see the road closed for hours.

   Just last month, motorists on the M1 were forced to endure an
   eight-hour wait.

   Why so, you ask. Must have been a multiple vehicle pile- up, right?

   No. A plastic bag leaking what appeared to be acid was found on the
   road.

   But that didn’t stop cops and highway patrol staff causing misery for
   thousands of commuters.

   To help you picture how many cars there were, consider this: for every
   minute traffic is stopped, the tailback grows by a MILE.

   A whole new approach from the police and Highways England traffic
   officers is needed. Police need to be more flexible and come up with
   creative ways to clear roads and stop people stewing in traffic for too
   long.

   We need a far more rapid response whenever there is an accident, more
   urgency.

   So what to do?

   In America, the police and highway patrol units have 4x4 vehicles with
   padded bullbars on the front — sturdy bumpers which can push cars off
   the carriageways.

   Rather than waiting for a tow-truck, they can shunt crashed or
   broken-down cars off the road, clearing the lanes and getting other
   motorists moving again.

   If the crash has led to a fatality, the area becomes a crime scene.

   It is understandable that in some tragic circumstances the road cannot
   be cleared as police need time to investigate.

   But we can leave the crashed cars in place while clearing the backed-up
   traffic in other ways.

   It might require some rather radical things, like reversing the flow of
   the traffic.

   For example, police could direct drivers the wrong way up a slip road
   to get traffic away from the scene.

   Obviously that needs to be managed as, when cars rejoin the roundabout,
   the police and Highways England would need to have people there to
   ensure it runs smoothly and everyone is diverted safely.

   The other solution is to have areas of the central reservation which
   can be removed in the event of a jam, allowing the traffic to loop
   around to the other side of the motorway towards the next exit.

   Drivers would be heading in the wrong direction, but would be able to
   divert to a different route and continue their journeys.

   Some sections of the motorway have a hard shoulder — let’s use it as a
   running lane. It is often used to get emergency vehicles to the scene
   of the crash. But once they are there, let’s also use it to ease
   congestion.

   The other problem we need to deal with is stopping people joining a
   closed road.

   Flashing message signs can warn drivers of a road closure but we need
   more overhead signs at junctions which lead to motorways.

   Vehicle technology is coming forward in leaps and bounds — we can use
   these new gadgets to stop jams getting even worse. We should develop
   more intelligent sat-nav systems which show the road ahead is closed or
   congested.

   They should be more dynamic and reflect the roads in real time.

   As cars themselves become more connected to technology, we will have
   even more options.

   We will have vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity so cars could effectively
   talk to each other by Bluetooth, warning the cars behind there is a
   jam.

   This technology is out there and being developed. Let’s use it.

   Being stuck in a traffic jam is miserable and, in the worst case
   scenario, people can be stuck for hours or even overnight, almost
   always without food.

   Cheap solutions

   Why doesn’t Highways England use a service such as Deliveroo to bring
   food, water or blankets to people that can’t get out of the jam?

   Couriers could weave through the traffic on bikes or motorbikes,
   dropping supplies off at each car. Eventually, we could even use
   drones.

   Highways England has made some provisions before — such as providing
   bottled water — but we can do more.

   All the solutions I am talking about are relatively cheap when compared
   to the amount congestion costs us now.

   Rather than having people sat flustered and frustrated in traffic for
   hours on end, let’s put our thinking caps on and get them moving.

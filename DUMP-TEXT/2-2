   A STRONG reception and support for the first leg of the inaugural
   Selangor Super Junior Circuit (SSJC) has set the tone for budding
   squash players in the state looking to prove themselves in the years to
   come.

   There was no shortage of skill, discipline and determination on display
   by the juniors despite it being a Under-9, 11 and 13 competition.

   The exclusion of the top-four ranked players for this two-leg circuit
   gave the budding players even more motivation to prove themselves among
   their peers.

   It was the Boys Under-11 finals that proved the most thrilling with
   Jaydn Jhan Karpal Singh Deo rising to the top as the winner in his
   group.

   Jaydn earned himself a spot in the finals after dispensing with his
   opponents in straight sets which included top seed S. Hemant but his
   toughest match was to come in the finals.

   The battle for the Boys Under-11 title was a nail-biter with second
   seed Tristan Sim taking the first and then fourth set, forcing a
   tiebreaker in the best-of-five match.

   But in the end it was Jaydn who managed to eke out ahead with a final
   score of 9-11, 11-6, 11-7, 6-11 and 12-10.

   Squash Racquet Association of Selangor (SRAS) vice-president Sivanesan
   C. Arul Chelvam explained that the tournament was designed as a proving
   ground for the large pool of young players in the state to move on to
   bigger things.

   The recently concluded first leg was held at the Lake View Club, Subang
   Jaya, and the second leg will take place in July. Both serve as a
   stepping stone for the juniors leading to the annual Selangor State
   Closed.

   “On the grassroots level, we are encouraging more clubs to form and get
   their players learning from young,” said Sivanesan.

   “And we added tournaments like this to the calendar so they can come
   and gauge themselves against the other players.

   “Both legs of the circuit are also a good place for the coaches to
   figure out where their players need to improve and who their
   competitors are.

   “SRAS will be looking at the performance of the players closely before
   and during the State Closed in September. We will then invite the top
   players to join our Unit Sukan Prestasi Tinggi Negri Selangor (USPTN)
   programme,” Sivanesan added.

   It wasn’t all about the budding players on the final day of the SSJC as
   SRAS also took time to recognise six seasoned juniors under the USPTN
   programme for achieving outstanding results in their SPM exams last
   year.

   Being focused on studies while juggling it with squash has always been
   a challenging task, but the determined teenagers managed to find a
   balance with both, chalking it down to time management and pulling back
   on squash time as the exams drew nearer.

   They are: S. Mhaithelly with 11 As, C. Nageena, 10 As, Lee Ka Ern, 8
   As, Lucas Low, 8 As, Teh Min En, 7As and Lee Mun Hong, 7As.

   On the special recognition, Sivanesan said SRAS wanted it to be a
   motivation to the up and coming players.

   “We want them to know that those players were active in squash and yet
   managed to do well academically,” he said.

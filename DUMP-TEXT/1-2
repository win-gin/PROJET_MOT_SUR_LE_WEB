         Atkins introduces ‘low sugar’ range of Harvest snack bars

   Atkins has launched its first natural bar in the UK called Harvest, as
   it aims to provide a lower sugar alternative to other products on the
   market.

   Already available in selected Tesco and Superdrug stores, the line is
   available in three flavours: dark chocolate and sea salt caramel;
   apricot, almond and coconut; and mixed nuts and chocolate.

   The Harvest bars are sold in vertical packs of 14, which Atkins claims
   is ‘ideal for front-of-store positioning’.

   They contain no artificial sweeteners, colouring or preservatives, and
   have 4.3g to 4.8g of naturally occurring sugars per bar.

   Unlike any other Atkins range, Atkins Harvest packaging is partly
   translucent, showcasing the raw ingredients inside.

   Atkins UK managing director Peter Valentine said: “We’ve been
   incredibly excited to launch Atkins Harvest to the market, a natural
   bar that’s low in sugar, carbs and high fibre, with no compromise on
   quality and taste. The vertical on-shelf display has also received
   positive feedback all round, with its optimal shelf space ROI.

   “The natural bar market is in high demand and the development of the
   Harvest range is in direct response to this. The Atkins portfolio
   continues to grow and we are confident we have a product that caters to
   all individual tastes and needs.”

   Each 40g bar is sold with a recommended price of £1.85.

   With machine learning behind myriad technologies, from online dating to
   driverless cars, we ask expert Dr Michael Osborne from the University
   of Oxford to give us the lowdown.

   What is machine learning?

   Artificial intelligence is really the goal of trying to develop
   algorithms that can learn and act. Older AI research ran up against
   this difficulty that people didn’t really know what intelligence was.
   Machine learning is a much more modern approach to solving the AI
   problem where we are coming from the bottom up rather than top down, so
   we are saying, well, let’s define these really crisp, well-defined,
   sub-problems, like classifying a handwritten digit as being either a
   one or two, and then use novel techniques within statistics and
   optimisation to create an algorithm that can improve its performance
   over time.

   What is an algorithm?

   An algorithm is a sequence of instructions or rules to complete a task.

   Where do we encounter machine learning?

   Anywhere and everywhere. The spam filter in your email account will be
   built around a machine learning algorithm. If you use Google translate
   , machine learning is trying to learn patterns in data to translate
   text from one language to another. Dating sites will use machine
   learning algorithms to try and recommend potential mates for you on the
   basis of your interests. [With] recommendation systems we are seeing
   the rise of machine learning all over the internet - if you buy
   products from Amazon it will recommend things to you on the basis of
   what you buy but also on what those like you buy.

   What are the benefits?

   It is not subject to the same biases or heuristics that humans are -
   for example, a study of judges found that their decisions about whether
   or not to award parole to prisoners were influenced by whether or not
   they had just had lunch. Algorithms can [also] scale up much better
   than humans can. You can fit many more processors than humans into a
   room.

   What are the challenges?

   There are technical challenges, obviously, related to designing these
   crisp problems that are relevant to a large section of industrial and
   societal needs. [Also] people are concerned that as algorithms get more
   intelligent they might start to substitute for what humans can do -
   they might impact on employment. We have this burden to try and make
   sure that we develop technologies that complement humans rather than
   replace them.

   What about the future?

   Health informatics will affect a lot of people’s lives. Everyone is
   carrying around phones that are recording characteristics of their
   activities - perhaps we can use that information to try and identify
   when someone’s about to have a heart attack or a seizure. Again this
   notion of trying to pick out underlying trends or patterns in data and
   use it to make predictions. The task of figuring out where a robot is
   in the world is very much a machine learning problem. Something I think
   a lot of people are justifiably excited about are autonomous vehicles –
   that is going to be a huge change in our lives.

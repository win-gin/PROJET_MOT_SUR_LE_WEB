   making security scanners at airports

   Engineering conglomerate Smiths Group is looking to attract programmers
   to help it develop life-changing equipment and beef up its digital
   skills.

   The claim came from the FTSE 100 group’s chief executive Andrew
   Reynolds Smith as he set out Smiths’ annual results and tries to turn
   the business around.

   Part of his strategy is launching what Smiths calls “digital forges”
   - research hubs working in artificial intelligence and big data - which
   can help develop new products and technologies to make the company an
   industrial leader.

   “We’re trying to attract people who might otherwise go to Google or
   Facebook," said Mr Reynolds Smith. "We we're looking for people who can
   pull together the digital and physical worlds to help make products,
   which can you can touch and see doing work in the hospitals and
   airports.

   “They will be doing some good rather than programming the next Angry
   Birds.”

   Smiths reported underlying group revenue slipping 1pc to £3.28bn as
   currency movements and acquisitions were stripped out, while pre-tax
   profit rose 17pc to £528m for the year to the end of July.

   Smiths Group

   The company has five main businesses: John Crane, supplying components
   for the energy industry; detection, making airport and port security
   scanners; a specialty medical devices unit; Interconnect, which
   produces electronic components; and Flex-Tek, which makes hoses used in
   industry and vehicles.

   Mr Reynolds Smith came on board two years ago with a remit to “build
   and grow” the business after years in the doldrums and amid speculation
   that it would be broken up.

   He has focused on selling off smaller, non-core or underperforming
   parts of the business and strengthening areas with high potential
   through acquisition and investment.

   This has included the £590m purchase of US security scanning business
   Morpho and taking R&D spending to 4.6pc of sales, as well as setting up
   a technology investment programme.

   The largest business in the group, John Crane, suffered a 4pc fall in
   underlying revenue to £885m during the year, as the low oil price
   continued to weigh, though the company said the rate of decline was
   slowing.

   The medical unit’s sales were 3pc lower at £951m, but Mr Reynolds Smith
   said a three- to five-year “refresh” of half of the product range was
   well under way and should see declines reverse in the first half of the
   coming year. Delays in launching new products also lowered performance.

   The detection business is currently integrating Morpho and revenues
   rose 4pc to £687m. Current security concerns mean detection is a growth
   opportunity, with Smiths developing full service and intelligent
   products instead of just selling machines.

   “The law says every European airport must have computerised tomography
   (CT) scanners in place by 2022, and before that legislation the number
   was in low-single digits,” the chief executive said, pointing to one
   opportunity for the business.

   He added that Smiths was using artificial intelligence to make its port
   scanners intelligent, so rather than sampling containers on a random
   basis, their journeys are tracked and those that could be at risk are
   singled out for inspection.

   However, despite the upbeat tone from management, investors were less
   confident, with the shares slipping more than 6pc.

   Analysts at Jefferies called update “satisfactory”, while Morgan
   Stanley said it saw little in the results to change the view that
   Smiths was failing to ride the improving trend in the sector.

   could supply the brains for Google's burgeoning robotics division

   A former child chess prodigy and computer game designer from London has
   sold his company to Google for around £300m in one of the Internet
   giant’s largest European acquisitions.

   Demis Hassabis, a computer scientist, is understood to have struck the
   deal with Google for his secretive start-up business Deep Mind
   Technologies, which specialises in artificial intelligence (AI) for
   computers.

   Hassabis, 37, has built the company by bringing together
   neuroscientists and computer engineers in an effort to use technology
   and medical research to help machines to mimic the brain’s ability to
   improve performance. He previously led a study at University College
   London in 2009 that scanned human brains and found “just by looking at
   neural activity we were able to say what someone was thinking”.

   Google founder Larry Page, who has expressed interest in making search
   commands easier by having an implant in the brain, is understood to
   have led the move to buy Deep Mind. Google is exploring smart
   technology that will enable it to go into space travel and create
   self-driving cars.

   The website The Information claimed that Google had beaten Facebook to
   the acquisition and had sealed the deal after agreeing to set up an
   ethics board to ensure that the AI technology was not abused.

   IBM recently pledged billion to fund Watson (above) - its own
   'cognitive computing' machine that its hoped will one day understand
   the nuances of human language.

   Hassabis is known within the computer gaming industry for having “a
   brain larger than a planet”. He began playing chess when he was four
   years old, reached Master Standard by the age of 13 and represented
   England.

   He did his first work in the games industry only two years later when
   he entered a competition to design a clone for Space Invaders. Going
   into the industry seemed like “the perfect marriage between games and
   programing”, he has said.

   By the age of 16 – having already completed his A-levels – Hassabis
   began working at games company Bullfrog and co-wrote the successful
   game Theme Park – which was based on an amusement park and released in
   1994 - in his year off before going to the University of Cambridge. His
   student friends struggled to believe he was the author of such a
   successful product until they saw his name on the packaging.

   After graduating with a triple first in computer science from Queen’s
   College, Hassabis quickly returned to the games industry and became a
   lead AI programmer at Lionhead Studios, the Surrey-based company
   founded by British computer games pioneer Peter Molyneux. Very soon
   afterwards the young graduate went off to set up his own business,
   Elixir Studios, where he was executive designer of a game called
   Republic: The Revolution, which attempted to recreate a “living,
   breathing city” and was nominated for a BAFTA.

   Although he has accepted that the project was over-ambitious, he told
   games website CVG that he had always been prepared to take chances.
   “I’m actually more worried about not taking risks and playing safe, not
   pushing myself enough,” he said. “It’s a bit perverse I suppose, and
   asking for trouble. I’ve always been prepared to jump in at the deep
   end and see if I can swim or not.”

   For many years, Hassabis was a successful competitor in the
   London-based Mind Sports Olympiad, taking part in its elite Pentamind
   contest – a sort of mental pentathlon. Hassabis was Pentamind champion
   in five of the first seven years after the Olympiad was founded in
   1997. His success meant that he was described as “probably the best
   games player in history”. Hassabis is an expert in the Japanese board
   game Shogi and an accomplished poker player.

   His next computer game Evil Genius, which was based on a Bond-style
   villain in an island lair, was more favourably received by critics.
   After selling the rights to publishers, Hassabis sold the studio and
   went into medical science in order to further pursue his interest in AI
   technology. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts for
   his game designs.

   As a cognitive neuroscientist he specialised in autobiographical memory
   (combining personal recollection and general knowledge) and amnesia. He
   investigated whether patients with lesions to the Hippocampus parts of
   their brains suffered damage to their imagination process as well as
   their memory recall. He completed his doctorate in cognitive
   neuroscience in 2009 at University College London and became a fellow
   at the college’s Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit and a visiting
   scientist at MIT and Harvard.

   'Evil Genius' was received favourably by critics

   In 2012, he left academia to set up Deep Mind Technologies, developing
   technology for e-commerce and gaming and creating computer systems
   capable of playing computer games. The company, which was based in
   central London’s Russell Square before moving to Fenchurch Street, has
   a reputation for secrecy. Its aim is said to be to develop computers
   that think like humans. It is said to employ 50 people including
   co-founders Shane Legg, a 40-year-old New Zealander, and Mustafa
   Seleyman, a 29-year-old Briton.

   Deep Mind’s investors include US Tesla car mogul Elon Musk, early
   Facebook investor Peter Thiel and the family of London app creator Nick
   d’Aloisio, who are all set for windfalls following the sale to Google.
   D’Aloisio, from south London, sold his news based app Summly to Yahoo!
   for a reported £19m early last year.
